# Database Comparison

These activities will have you research different types of databases to compare and contrast their relative strengths.

Having a better idea of which choices you have for databases will help prepare you for backend interview questions.

In addition to the videos linked in this readme, you should do your own independent research in order to answer these questions!

## Part One - SQL vs. NoSQL

NoSQL databases are a massive class of databases. What might lead you to choose a NoSQL database for your application? Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruz-vK8IesE) and then edit this file to answer the questions below:
